\section{Conclusions}

In this project, we investigated heterogeneous citation and coauthorship networks connected to nine breast cancer data series from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository and compared three ranking algorithms (baseline individual network ranking, Corank, and Multirank). Based on our limited preliminary study, we showed that the Multirank approach based on a tensor representation holds great promise to the DataRank project, but multi-faceted data collection and fine-grained annotations are still necessary to make the best use of this technique for personalized information retrieval.
